Connect to the internet (wanfacing)\n  2. Provide VPN services to other containers (homefacing)\n- Plex and Overseerr use both networks because they need to:\n  1. Communicate with other local services (homefacing)\n  2. Be accessible from the internet for remote streaming/access (wanfacing)\n\nThe network separation provides:\n1. Better security through isolation\n2. Clearer organization of services\n3. Control over which services can access the internet\n4. The ability to route certain traffic through the VPN while keeping other traffic on your regular network\n\nThis is particularly useful in a media server setup where you want to keep potentially risky traffic (like torrenting) isolated and protected by a VPN while allowing other services direct access to your network or the internet.\nare you sure thats all the networks?\n\nLooking at the docker-compose file again, there's actually one more network configuration used:\n\n```yaml\nqbittorrent:\n  network_mode: service:vpn # run on the vpn network\n```\n\nThe qBittorrent container uses a special networking mode where it shares the network stack of the VPN container. This isn't a separate network per se, but rather a different way of networking where qBittorrent uses the exact same network interfaces as the VPN container. This ensures that all qBittorrent traffic is forced to go through the VPN.\n\nSo to summarize all networking configurations in the file:\n\n1. `homefacing` (external network)\n2. `wanfacing` (external network)\n3. `network_mode: service:vpn` (shared network stack with VPN container)\n\nThis third configuration is particularly important for privacy and security as it ensures that the torrent client can only communicate through the VPN tunnel.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":64}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":28},"start":4496,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":65}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":29},"start":6136,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":66}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":56},"start":6174,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":67}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":57},"start":7059,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":68}}}],"summary":"Media Stack Network Configuration","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
