The typical structure for a Rust project with tests looks like this:\n\n```\nyour-project/\n├── src/\n│   ├── main.rs\n│   └── ...\n└── tests/\n    └── main.spec.rs\n```\n\nThen, you can run the test with the following command from the root directory of your project:\n\n```\ncargo test\n```\n\nThis command will compile your project in test mode and run all the tests in the `tests` directory.\n\nIf you want to run a specific test, you can use the `--test` flag followed by the module or test name. For example, to run only the `test_main` test in `main.spec.rs`, you can use:\n\n```\ncargo test --test main.spec -- --nocapture\n```\n\nThe `--nocapture` flag is used to print the output from the `println!` statements in the `main` function to the console, which is captured by the test.\n\nNote that Rust tests are typically structured using the `#[test]` attribute and placed in separate files or modules from the main application code. This separation helps maintain code organization and allows for better testability.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":26}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":20},"start":606,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":27}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":21},"start":1902,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":28}}}],"summary":"Test main.rs function output","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
