The setting shown appears to be using a non-existent Claude model name. To fix this, you should use one of the currently available Claude models.\n\nHere's the corrected configuration:\n\n```json\n\"assistant\": {\n  \"default_model\": {\n    \"provider\": \"anthropic\",\n    \"model\": \"claude-3-sonnet\"\n  },\n  \"version\": \"2\"\n}\n```\n\nThe change made is:\n- Changed `\"claude-3-5-sonnet-latest\"` to `\"claude-3-sonnet\"`\n\nThe available Claude models for Zed are:\n- `claude-3-opus`\n- `claude-3-sonnet`\n- `claude-2.1`\n\nChoose the model that best fits your needs. Claude-3-sonnet is a good balance of capability and speed.\nthere is also this warning: `Matches multiple schemas when only one must validate.`\n\n\nThat warning is related to JSON schema validation. To fix the \"Matches multiple schemas\" warning, you might need to ensure the entire settings file follows the correct schema structure. Here's a properly formatted version:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"assistant\": {\n    \"default_model\": {\n      \"provider\": \"anthropic\",\n      \"model\": \"claude-3-sonnet\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nI notice I removed the `\"version\": \"2\"` line since it might be causing the schema conflict. If the editor still works without it, you can leave it out. However, if Zed specifically requires the version field, you should keep it.\n\nIf you're still seeing the warning, you might want to:\n1. Check if there's a newer version of Zed's settings schema\n2. Validate your entire settings.json file\n3. Consider reporting this as a potential bug to Zed's issue tracker if the warning persists with valid settings\n\nCould you share more of your settings.json file for better context?\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":130}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":9},"start":235,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":131}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":10},"start":910,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":132}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":52},"start":995,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":133}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":61},"start":996,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":134}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":62},"start":1922,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":135}}}],"summary":"Fix Zed Assistant Model Config","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
